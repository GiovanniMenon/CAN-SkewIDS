# CAN-SkewIDS

CAN-SkewIDS is an implementation of the proof-of-concept (PoC) described in the referenced paper. It serves as an *Intrusion Detection System (IDS)* for the *Controller Area Network (CAN)* protocol, is designed to detect malicious activity by analyzing clock skew to fingerprint *Electronic Control Units (ECUs)*.   The approach is based on the model presented in the paper, referred in their work as a **Clock-based Intrusion Detection System (CIDS)**.
